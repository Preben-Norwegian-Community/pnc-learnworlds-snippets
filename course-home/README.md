# Set up snippets to a course

## You should

1) Add the `page-html.html` code to the "custom code" under the nav tab "page" and under the tab "logged in HTML". Note that for the dev version you can use `port 445`.
2) Add the `web-component-injector.html` code in a new section with embedded code. Set the section as visible just to "logged-in" users, in the "actions" tab.
